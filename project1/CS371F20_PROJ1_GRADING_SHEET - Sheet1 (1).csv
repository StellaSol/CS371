"For Q&A tasks, fill your answers in the cell, or at least fill “A”, “P” or “N” in all the ”Your self-evaluation” cells. 
A-all finished   P-Partially finished  N-None finished
If you mark the task “N”, it receives 25% of max possible points for the task (It does not apply to extra-point tasks).
If you leave it blank, it receives 0 points. 
If your mark the task ""A"" or ""P"" but zero work is done for the task, then it receives 0 points.
Please leave ""score"" cells blank for course staff
If your code does not build,  your code will not receive more than 50% of max possible points",,,,,

How many system calls are placed in total by each HelloWorld program?,4,The java HelloWorld program had 1838 system calls and the C HelloWorld program had 34 system calls,0,,0
"How many different system calls (i.e., counting only one occurrence of a particular system call) are placed by each HelloWorld program? ",4,Java's program had 47 different system calls and C's program had 13 system calls,0,,0
"Based on your intuition, on reading man pages, and on the information in the trace files, pick three system calls placed by the Java HelloWorld program and say what you think they do (hint: use man). ",4,"I picked the system calls: execve(), munmap(), mkdir().  The system execve() executes the programm referred to by pathname. The pathname has to be a binary executable or it has to have a script. The system call munmap() maps or unmaps filles or devices into memories. This call creates a new mapping the virtual address of calling process. The system call mkdir() creates a new directory.",0,,0
"In lecture, we discussed how C library translates a C lib function such as open to sys_open. It is easy to understand how this works for a C program. However, does this still apply to Java programs? State your reasoning with evidence.",4,"Yes, this does apply to Java programs as well. This is evident in the Java API which provides API to the JVM. A specific example would be the write() system call. The write() System call is mapped to ""System.out.print."" This can be shown in this line in the tracefile_java: write(1, ""Hello, World"", 12)      = 12. This line shows that the print method of java is actually mapped to a systeml kole in the kernel, quite similar to C",0,,0
